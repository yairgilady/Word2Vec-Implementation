# Word2Vec-Implementation
This repository contains a Word2vec Implementation.

using python and the API of tensorflow.Keras, I traind a word2vec model and got as a result embedding.
With this embedding, we can find for every word the words that are related to it the most, and in less than a second of search time.

For further instructions, check out the pdf attached, and look in tensorflow official website: https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/word2vec

## Notice, that training your own model will take some time, especially if you're changing the dimentions size and and batch number.
